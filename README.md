# WD_mass-radius_relation
Module for calculating the radius and mass of white dwarfs from effective temperature (Teff) and surface gravity (logg) by interpolating the Argentenian (Althaus et al. 2013) or Montreal (Bedard et al. 2020) group WD evolutionary models to use as a mass-radius relation.  1. Required packages: > Python 3.6 or higher > numpy > scipy > astropy > pandas   2. Donwload the folder WD_mass-radius_relation. Go to the downloaded path in the Terminal and enter python or ipython.  3. import WD_MR_relation as MR  4. To calculate the radius from input Teff and logg use the function MR.Radius_from_teff_logg.
